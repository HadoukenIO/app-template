# Hadouken Angular Template

A simple Angular template.  The purpose of this repository is to allow users to get started with Hadouken immediately by providing a development setup that does not require initial configuration.  The setup has minimal dependencies and the feature set is intentionally limited. Any further configuration can be achieved by editing the `app.json` file: [Application Config](https://openfin.co/application-config/).

### How to use this:

* Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/HadoukenIO/app-template`
* Checkout angular branch: `cd app-template` & `git checkout angular`
* Install the dependencies: `npm install`
* Start the live-server and launch the application: `npm start`
